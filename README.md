# GraphTheoryProject - G00377815

# Why this Repository exists.
This Repository is my submission for my Graph Theory Project in 3rd Year of Software Development in GMIT. It contains my Jupyter Notebooks for Heap Sort and Graph Isomorphism, as well as this README to give you a detailed overview of the repository, its notebooks and their contents, and also how to run the notebooks themselves and the python code contained in them.

# Setup/Environment Instructions.
In order to run these notebooks, you will need to install Python. I recommend installing Anaconda which can be installed here: https://www.anaconda.com/
Jupyter is a package within Python that runs a web application that will show up in your web browser. The command terminal I personally used throughout this project was 
Cmder which can be installed here: https://cmder.net/ , however any terminal of your choosing can be used to run these notebooks as long as you are able to run Python within it. Once you have the notebooks downloaded into your chosen folder, you can run the command "jupyter notebook" to run Jupyter in this chosen directory, as depicted here:

Make sure you are in the right directory, as Jupyter will only be able to access the files or notebooks contained within the current directory you are located in.

These notebooks contain snippets of Python code, which  is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization.
It was designed for readability, which is why it has a similar look to pseudocode. Please take note to the comments contained in the notebooks for explanations on the python code being implemented.


# Heap-Sort.ipynb
This notebook contains:
* A general summary of what heap sort is
* The steps that the Heap Sort Function takes when sorting its elements.
* An implementation of Heap Sort using Python.
* Explanation of the time complexity of the functions used in the heap sort funnction, as well as diagrams to illustrate.
* Heap Sorts Pros and Cons
* How Graph Theory is used in Heap Sort.
* References section for areas of research for this notebook.
